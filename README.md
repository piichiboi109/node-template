## Reusable GitHub Actions Workflow for Node.js

This project uses a reusable GitHub Actions workflow to automate Node.js CI tasks such as installing dependencies, running tests, and linting code. By leveraging reusable workflows, you can standardize CI processes across multiple repositories.

### Example Usage

To use the reusable workflow, add the following to your repositoryâ€™s `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  node-ci:
    uses: your-org/node-workflows/.github/workflows/node-ci.yml@v1
    with:
      node-version: '18'
```

### Benefits

- **Consistency:** Ensures all Node.js projects follow the same CI steps.
- **Maintainability:** Update workflow logic in one place for all consuming repos.
- **Scalability:** Easily extend or customize for different Node.js versions or steps.
